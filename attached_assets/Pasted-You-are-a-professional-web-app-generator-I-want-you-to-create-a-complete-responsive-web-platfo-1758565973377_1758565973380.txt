You are a professional web app generator.  
I want you to create a **complete responsive web platform** called **Daily English Word**.  

### Concept:
The website teaches users **one powerful English word every day** with examples, pronunciation, and a short quiz.  
It must have a **modern UI/UX**, clean typography, light/dark themes, and be fully mobile-friendly.  
The site should be **ready for Google AdSense ads** (with ad slots in header, sidebar, and between content).  

### Pages & Features:
1. **Home Page**
   - Display today’s word (with IPA phonetics, part of speech, CEFR level).
   - Show short definition, synonyms, antonyms.
   - Provide 2–3 usage examples (English + Arabic translation).
   - Section for a "Daily Tip" about how to use the word.
   - Place AdSense ad slots (top banner + in-content).

2. **Quiz Page**
   - Daily mini quiz (3–5 multiple-choice questions about today’s or previous words).
   - User selects answers and sees instant feedback + explanations.
   - Track user’s daily streak and show progress.
   - Place AdSense ad slot in sidebar.

3. **Archive Page**
   - List of previous “Word of the Day” entries with pagination.
   - Clicking a word shows its details (definition + examples + quiz).
   - Place small ad unit between word entries.

4. **Profile / Progress**
   - Show user streak, total words learned, and points from quizzes.
   - Gamification: badges for 7 days, 30 days, 100 days streak.
   - Option to toggle light/dark theme.

5. **About / Contact**
   - Brief about the platform (powered by Gemini AI).
   - Contact form for suggestions or feedback.

### Functionality:
- The site must **fetch “Word of the Day” from Gemini API** automatically, based on the current date.  
- Store last visited date and streak in **local storage** (no Firebase SDK).  
- Ensure **deterministic prompts** to Gemini (same date → same word).  
- Support **English UI** but include Arabic translations inside examples.  

### Design:
- Modern, clean, minimalist (similar to Duolingo + Fluent UI).
- Rounded cards, shadows, smooth transitions.
- Use a grid layout (word card + quiz card).
- Light/Dark toggle button in header.
- Responsive: must look great on mobile and desktop.

### Monetization:
- Integrate **Google AdSense placeholders** in multiple positions:
  - Top header banner
  - In-article ad under the word definition
  - Sidebar ad in quiz page
  - Small ads between archive items

### Requirements:
- Generate all pages, routes, and components.
- Use HTML/CSS/JS (or Next.js/React if supported).
- Include comments where I should insert my AdSense `ca-pub` and `slot` IDs.
- Make it fast, SEO-friendly, and lightweight.
